- Switched to Paper API for better performance and ease of development.
- Dropped `Spigot` and `1.20` support
  - From now on, new releases will only support 1.21+.
  - There might be bugfix releases for 1.20 and Spigot if necessary.

    - `/clickmobs config set <option> <value>`: Sets a configuration option.
    - `/clickmobs config get <option>`: Gets the value of a configuration option.
    - `/clickmobs config path`: Prints the path to the **configuration file**.
    - `/clickmobs config reload`: Reloads the configuration file.
    - Removed the old reload command and `cm` alias.
