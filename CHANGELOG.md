- Switch to Configured (https://github.com/Clickism/Configured) for configuration files.
- Switched to YAML for the configuration file.
- Moved the configuration file to ".../config/ClickMobs/config.yml".
- Changed blacklisting/whitelisting to use tags:
  - Available tags: `?all, ?hostile, ?baby, ?tamed, ?nametagged, ?silent, ?mob`
  - For more information, read the wiki: https://github.com/Clickism/ClickMobs/wiki/Tags
  - Removed options "allow-hostile" and "only-allow-whitelisted". Use tags instead.
- Warning: Due to the config changes, you will need to set up the config file again.
